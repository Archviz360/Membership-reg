This program allows you to manage member records effectively. You can add new members, edit existing member details, remove members, and print the current list of all members.

Please note that all text boxes must be completed when adding or editing a member. If a new member chooses not to provide specific information, please enter "N/A" in that text box.

System Requirements and Driver Information: To ensure the program works properly, make sure the following drivers and software are installed:

.NET 6 Framework
Microsoft ACE OLEDB 12 or later, depending on your Windows version.
A compatible version of Microsoft Office installed, as this program works with CSV files.
If you are unable to connect to the internet, please contact your service provider or IT support to manually download and install these drivers.

File Format Compatibility:

The program only works with CSV files. It does not support XLSX files.
All exported files will be in CSV format.
For more advanced edits, such as applying themes or creating enhanced printouts, we recommend using Microsoft Excel, available in Office 365, Office 2024, or an older version of Office.

If you prefer to use free alternatives, LibreOffice is a suitable choice. You can download it at: https://www.libreoffice.org/
